# Advent of Code 2022 - GitHub Copilot ONLY
I am going to attempt solving the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles using only 
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) with the Go language. This means that I will only be
writing comments and I will only be allowed to accept code that Copilot generates.

Each day will get it's own directory.
